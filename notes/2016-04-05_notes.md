### April 5 Notes
#### Haskell time

Calling haskell: `ghci`

```haskell
let a = 4
-- get type of 'a' (it's an integer)
:t a
head [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
:t head -- returns [a] -> a
```

#### Type class
`:t 3`  
`Num a => a` means that "3" is a generic number class

This is not the same as OO polymorphism. More like interfaces

(Some) Haskell interfaces:
* Equality
* Ordinality


```haskell
let a = 3 -- but as a float?
let a = 3.0 -- fool's way to make a double, not a float :/

[sumValues :: Int -> Int -> Int]
sumValues x y = x + y

a :: Float
a = 3.0

head' :: [Float] -> Float
head' (x:_) = x

-- first element x, save the rest of it xs
(x : xs)
-- get rid of the front of the list
(_:x:xs)
-- get second element
(_:x:_)
```
