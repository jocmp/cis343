### Final Exam

1) What do you dislike about current languages?
2) 75 pts - If you could design one
  * Type system
    * Typed with "var" or "let" for variables and constant values
    * Statically typed (checked by compiler) with optionally designated data type
        * this can add to some confusion with Readability, and decreases orthogonality
    * Strongly typed
    * Booleans, ordinal types: basic numeric types, strings, but char type may not
    be necessary.
    * Small, understandable amount of constructed data types, such as list, sets,
    and maps ala Python
  * Bindings
    * Static binding, with optional type inference
  * Paradigm
    * Object-oriented, functional capabilities such as map or filter
    * Functional capabilities allow for variety
  * What domains?
    * General purpose, speed-oriented.
  * Describe goals
    * High orthogonality, low multiplicity
      * {} vs end
      * ++ vs +=
    * Readability
      * Limit
    * Writability
      * Light syntax, especially for function/method signatures
      * Lose the semicolons, keep the brackets
    * Reliability
      * Type checking and number type casting

3) 10 pts - Haskell
4) 15 pts - misc, logic/assignment question
