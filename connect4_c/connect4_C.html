<h1>CS 343 Project: Connect 4 in C</h1>

This assignment was originally prepared by Prof. Nandigam.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

Using arrays and command-line arguments in C.

<h2> Problem Specification</h2>

<p>Write a C program to play a game of Connect 4. Here is the
   description of this game taken from <a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">Wikipedia:</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
   Connect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, and Four in a Line) is a two-player game in
   which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping their colored discs from the top into a
   seven-column, six-row vertically-suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space
   within the column. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other
   vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before one's opponent can do so. There are many variations on the board size,
   the most commonly used being <code>7&times;6</code>, followed by <code>8&times;7</code>, <code>9&times;7</code>,
   and <code>10&times;7</code>.
</blockquote>

<p>You can play this game online here:
   <a target="_top" href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html">
      <code>http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html</code></a>.
</p>

<p>For this project, the game will be played on square boards only. (Allowing non-square boards adds complexity to
   the win-detection algorithm that doesn't relate to this class.  You
   are welcome to support non-square boards if you wish, as long as
   you dont' change the public interface.) Your program should take two optional command-line
   arguments: the length of one side of the board (must be at least 3) and the number of connects required to win the
   game (must be at least <code>3</code>). If the command line arguments are missing,
   the board size defaults to <code>8</code> and the number of connects defaults to <code>4</code>.
   Implement the game for two players. If the command line arguments are invalid, print an error message and quit.</p>

<p class="listHeader">Your program should be invoked using a command of form <code>c4 size win_length</code>. For
   example, the following command starts a game with a board size of <code>5&times;5</code> and <code>6</code> for the
   win length:</p>

   <pre>
   $ ./c4 5 6
   Beginning a new game with a 5 x 5 board, and a win length of 6
   </pre>

<h2>Design requirements</h2>

<p class="listHeader">For the most part, you can design your program as you wish; however,
   there are a few requirements:</p>
<ul>
   <li>You must divide your program into reasonable sized functions. A program with a single <code>main</code>
      method is not acceptable, neither is a program with a few huge functions.
   </li>
   <li>The game logic should go in a file named <code>connect4_engine.c</code>.</li>

   <li>You must write a corresponding header file (<code>connect4_engine.h</code>). This header file should contain
      declarations for only those functions that need to be visible outside <code>connect4_engine.c</code>.
   </li>

   <li><code>connect4_engine.c</code> may not contain a <code>main</code> function. I suggest you place
      <code>main</code> in a file named <code>connect4.c</code>.
</ul>

<p>I will test your game both programatially and from the command line. My test program will drive your game by
   alternately calling the following two methods:</p>

<dl>
   <dt><code>int place_token(int player, int column, int num_rows, int num_columns, int
      board[num_rows][num_columns])</code></dt>
   <dd>
      This function should simulate the specified player dropping a token in the specified column. Columns are
      indexed beginning with <code>0</code>.
   </dd>

   <dt><code>int winner(int num_rows, int num_columns, int length_to_win, int array[num_rows][num_columns])</code></dt>
   <dd>This function should examine the contents of <code>array</code> and return the number of the player who won,
      or <code>-1</code> if nobody has won.
   </dd>
</dl>

<p>Thus, your design must work with my tests. My tests will use <code>-1</code> to indicate an empty slot,
   <code>0</code> for player 1, and <code>1</code> for player 2. If you follow these three conventions,
   I don't see how your code won't work with my tests. However, if I'm wrong, let me know ASAP. (This means more
   than two days before the project is due!)</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p class="listHeader"> There are two ways to get started:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Easy way: Go to your CS 343 project directory and type
      <code class=".nowrap">git clone eos22.cis.gvsu.edu:/home/kurmasz/public_html/CS343/Connect4_C.git</code>
   </li>

   <li class="listheader">Longer way: Create a new directory in your CS 343 directory and download:
      <ul>
         <li><a href="CuTest.c"><code>CuTest.c</code></a></li>
         <li><a href="CuTest.h"><code>CuTest.h</code></a></li>
         <li><a href="c4_engine_test.c"><code>c4_engine_test.c</code></a></li>
         <li><a href="makefile"><code>makefile</code></a></li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, add tests to <code>c4_engine_test.c</code>, then write <code>connect4_engine.h</code> and
   <code>connect4_engine.c</code>. When your tests are complete, and your code passes your tests,
   write a driver program to actually play a game.</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Make sure your code exhibits overall good design: Make your functions reasonably small,
      avoid needless duplication of code, choose reasonable variable names, etc.
   </li>
   <li>Add comments where appropriate.</li>
   <li>Make sure your code <em>gracefully</em> handles unexpected and/or invalid input. For example,
      the program shouldn't crash if the user tries to put a token in a full column.
   </li>
   <li>Your program should recognize a tie.</li>
   <li>Don't forget to test your code using different board sizes and win lengths.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>When your code is complete and correct, submit
   <code>connect4_engine.c</code>, <code>connect4_engine.h</code>, <code>c4_engine_test.c</code> and any
   other necessary files that you wrote in Blackboard. Your grade will
   depend primarily on when I receive code from you that passes all
   <em>my</em> tests:</p>

<ul>
   <li>You will receive a one point bonus (up to three) for every day your code is
      early.
   </li>
   <li>You will receive a 10% penalty (rounded up) for every day your code is
      late.
   </li>
   <li>In addition, you will receive an additional 10% penalty every time you
      submit code that does not pass my tests.
</ul>

<p>For example, if you submit code on the due date that fails my
   tests, then submit correct code two days later, your penalty is
   30%: 10% for failing tests, and 20% for the <em>correct</em>
   submission being two days late.</p>

<p>I will not grade code submitted without a reasonably complete set
   of test cases.</p>

<p>Extra Credit (5%): Modify your game to allow non-square boards.</p>
